## About This Repository

Welcome! This repository contains Android applications that I have developed to showcase my skills in mobile app development.

### Why This Repository?

Due to financial constraints, I haven't yet been able to publish these apps on the Google Play Store. However, I want to make my work accessible to potential employers and collaborators. Each project has been bundled into a folder with available project files of diffrent formats included in the named folder. Below is a brief summary of what each folder entails.

### How to Review My Work

1. Browse the repository for project files.
2. Check the documentation and screenshots provided for each app.
