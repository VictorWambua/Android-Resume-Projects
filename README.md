## About This Repository
Welcome! This repository contains Android applications that I have developed to showcase my skills in mobile app development. 

### Why This Repository?
Due to financial constraints, I haven't yet been able to publish these apps on the Google Play Store. However, I want to make my work accessible to potential employers and collaborators. While APK files are available here, I highly recommend checking out the source code to evaluate my coding practices, UI/UX approach, and app architecture.

### How to Review My Work
1. Browse the repository for project source code.
2. Check the documentation and screenshots provided for each app.
3. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need a demonstration.

Your feedback and support are highly appreciated. Thanks for stopping by!
